## Getting started

**1. Fork and clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skeval.git
cd skeval
```

**2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**3. Verify everything works**
```bash
pytest tests/
python -c "import skeval; print(skeval.__version__)"
```

## Branching strategy

- `main` — stable, always releasable
- Feature branches — named after the issue they fix, e.g. `fix/27-remove-unused-deps` or `feature/16-sklearn-api`

Always branch off `main` unless you are building on top of an open PR.

---

## Making changes

- One pull request per issue
- Keep changes focused — do not mix unrelated fixes in one PR
- Reference the issue number in your PR description: `Closes #16`
- Write or update tests for any code you change

---

## Code standards

We enforce the following automatically via CI:

| Tool | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `black` | Code formatting |
| `isort` | Import ordering |
| `flake8` | Style and common errors |
| `bandit` | Security issues |

Run them locally before pushing:
```bash
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/
bandit -r src/ -ll
```

**Docstrings:** Every public class and function must have a Google-style docstring with `Args`, `Returns`, `Raises`, and at least one `Example`.

**Comments:** Only add a comment when the *why* is non-obvious. Do not explain what the code does — well-named variables do that already.

---

## Running tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/skeval --cov-report=term-missing
```

All tests must pass before a PR can be merged. New features require new tests. Coverage must not drop below 85%.

---

## Submitting a pull request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a PR against `main` on the skeval repository
3. Fill in the PR template — include what you changed and why
4. A maintainer will comment `/run-ci` to trigger the CI checks
5. Address any review feedback
6. Once approved and CI passes, the PR will be merged

---

## Reporting bugs

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/skeval-ai/skeval/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) using the bug report template. Include:

- What you did
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Your Python version, OS, and skeval version (`python -c "import skeval; print(skeval.__version__)"`)

---

## Suggesting features

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/skeval-ai/skeval/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) using the feature request template. Describe:

- The problem you are trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternatives you considered
